                    <p>Me and my coworker were tasked with developing a new website for Vancouver Coastal Health’s (VCH) Employee Family Assistance Program (EFAP). EFAP offers counselling and wellness services to VCH employees and their families. My main role was to handle all of the web development, but I also assisted in creating the brand, and informing the design of the website. Our first goal was to create a brand that was easily recognizable and gave employees a sense of “calmness” when viewing. My coworker created the design but wasn’t sure which colors to use. In order to help, I created this color theory chart which not only helped us decide on the final brand colors but helped us explain the design choices to the client.</p>

                    <img class="portfolio-img" src="img/efap-color-theory.png"/>

        <div class="container-max">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="twelve columns">
                    <p>We learned from the client that the main goal of the website was to get people to call in or book an appointment. In order to achieve this, I created a popup modal that displayed the first time a user visited the site using JavaScript and SessionStorage (left). This version of the site was very close to the final, but also featured a slide down navigation that was hidden when the website loaded.</p>
                    <p>The clients felt that the call to action needed to be more prominent. To fix this, I created a full screen splash page that contained all of information deemed necessary. Not only did this splash page grab attention better – I designed it to reduce cognitive load, so that visitors who may need immediate assistance can find it as soon as possible (right).

                    <p>The final design of the website did not change drastically, but I fixed the navigation bar to the top of the page to make it more accessible and user friendly. I learned throughout the project that the target audience required more of the website’s features to be simplified, so I continued to work on those issues while building the website using modern web technologies. It is now live at <a href="https://employee-wellness.ca" target="_blank">https://employee-wellness.ca</a></p>
